Highly skilled and results-driven Project Manager with a proven track record in leading complex initiatives and driving successful outcomes, and a demonstrated ability to lead cross-functional teams and oversee project life-cycles from initiation to delivery. Specializing in data analysis, stakeholder engagement, and strategic planning, I bring extensive experience in the humanitarian sector, particularly in health capacity analysis, displacement monitoring and public service improvement. With a strong focus on data-driven decision-making, I excel in developing innovative solutions and managing teams to achieve project objectives.
